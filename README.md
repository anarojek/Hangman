# Hangman
Simple game of guessing words from three categories: series, anime and food. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to being "hanged". I made this app while learning programing in JavaScript. I created the graphics myself. 

I used array to sort password into the appropriate categories. I put the letters in array also. The passwords are generated randomly.
